# Proximal gradient descent

Implementation of:
 - Proximal gradient descent
 - Accelerated proximal gradient descent

for: 
 - Logisitic regression 
 - Label propagation [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Label%20propagation%20is%20a%20semi,have%20labels%20(or%20classifications).&text=Label%20propagation%20is%20an%20algorithm%20for%20finding%20communities)
 
The jupyter notbook (proximal_gd.ipynb) introduces the problem and then walks you through the code in detail.
The entire optimization routine (including gradient calculations) is implemented from scratch.
